The following folder consists of the three notebooks for the different CVRP solving approaches and their varaiants.<br>
<ul>
  <li><h2> CVRP</h2>
    The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is a VRP in which vehicles with limited carrying capacity need to pick up or deliver items to various locations. The items have a quantity, such as weight or volume, and each vehicle has a maximum capacity that they can carry. The problem is to pick up or deliver the items with the least cost, while never exceeding the capacity of the vehicles.<br>
  <li><h2> CVRPTW</h2>
    This is a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) with time windows. A typical VRP model consists of a depot and multiple customers in known distances from the depot. Challenge is to find the optimal route for the vehicle which starts the tour at the depot, to visit all the customers and come back to the depot with the minimum possible distance covered. We can make the problem more realistic by considering multiple vehicles available at depot and routes for each vehicle to visit all the customers. Hence, in this VRP, multiple vehicles available at depot will complete their respective tours starting and ending at depot so total distance travelled is minimum. This model is very helpful in saving time and cost of fuel of vehicles for any purpose or business by formulating minimum distance coverage tours.<br>
  <li><h2> CVRP_with_greedy_approach</h2>
    In this CVRP solving approach, we will try to find the optimal routes for all the vehicles used and try to minimise the distance travelled in multiple vehicle routing problems(MVRP). This problem is similar to the other problems solved. In this approach, all the vehicles will have different capacities. And the difference will be in the approach of finding the routes to all the customers from the node.<br>
